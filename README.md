BB-Express
==========

Boilerplate app for Backbone &amp; Express

Nothing too complex, just for myself really...and anyone else that might find it useful!

Enjoy!

Basically a mash-up of Jack Franklin's [Express Backbone repo](https://github.com/javascript-playground/express-backbone-library-app) and my own [A View To A Kill](https://github.com/benhowdle89/aviewtoakill) Backbone starter app.
